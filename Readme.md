This is one of the most common creation pattern. And this is the objective of our first task.

**Requirements:**

- A zoo is needed to be created with a name and a surface ( 0 > surface > 10001), we need to create the zones for the
  animals and to put animals in there.
- The sum of the surface of all zones can not be higher than the zoo surface size.
- When recover the data from a Zoo all zones are returned too.
